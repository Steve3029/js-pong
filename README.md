# js-pong

In sprint-9, I would like to learn how to use javascript and canvas of HTML 5 to implement a animation. 
So I developed a Javascript version of simple pong game. You can play table tennis with a simple artifitial intelligence 
by controlling the paddle on the left. The person who get 5 point firstly will win.
